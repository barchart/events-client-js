## A usage guide for generating reports (using this SDK)

The Barchart Event Tracking System collects usage statistics from various software systems. This document will describe how to export data from the system, presumably for analysis by external tools (e.g. Tableua, Grafana, etc) using the HTTP API directly.

## Alternatives

### JavaScript SDK

This JavaScript API handles HTTP-based interactions with the backend. If you would prefer, you can interact with the backend directly. The readme file for the raw HTTP API can be found [here](https://github.com/barchart/events-client-js/blob/master/README_API.md).
